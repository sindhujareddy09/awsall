# Continuous Integration

#### What is CI?
    CI stands for Continuous Integration, which is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, and then an automated build and testing process is triggered to detect and resolve any issues or conflicts that may arise.

#### Purposse CI?
    The purpose of CI is to catch and fix problems in the code as early as possible, which reduces the risk of errors being introduced into the software and increases the speed of delivery. 
    It also enables faster and more frequent releases of software.

#### CI Vendors ?
    There are many CI vendors that offer tools and services for implementing CI, such as:

        Jenkins: An open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, testing, and deploying software.

        Travis CI: A cloud-based CI service that supports testing and deploying software projects hosted on GitHub.

        CircleCI: A cloud-based CI/CD platform that supports building, testing, and deploying software projects hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

        GitLab CI/CD: A built-in CI/CD platform that comes with GitLab, a web-based Git repository manager.

        TeamCity: A CI server developed by JetBrains that supports building and testing software for various platforms and programming languages.

        Bamboo: A CI/CD server developed by Atlassian that supports building, testing, and deploying software for various platforms and programming languages.

    These CI vendors provide a range of features and integrations to support different types of software development workflows and teams.

#### How CI works?
     Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves continuously integrating code changes into a shared repository and then automatically building and testing the software to ensure that the changes are compatible with the existing codebase.

     Here is how Continuous Integration works:
        1. Developers write code and commit their changes to a shared code repository, such as Git.

        2. The Continuous Integration server monitors the repository for changes and automatically pulls the latest code changes.

        3. The Continuous Integration server runs automated builds and tests on the code changes to check for any issues or conflicts.

        4. If any issues are found during the build or testing process, the Continuous Integration server notifies the development team and prevents the changes from being merged into the main codebase until the issues are resolved.

        5. If the build and tests pass successfully, the changes are merged into the main codebase, and the process starts over again.

    By continuously integrating code changes, developers can catch and fix issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of introducing errors into the software and improving the overall quality of the codebase. 
    It also enables faster feedback and faster delivery of new features to end-users.    

### Use cases:
    Continuous Integration (CI) has several use cases, including:

        1. Ensuring Code Quality: 
        CI helps ensure that code changes are tested and reviewed before they are merged into the main codebase, improving overall code quality and reducing the risk of bugs.

        2. Improving Collaboration: 
        CI promotes collaboration between developers by providing a shared code repository and automated testing, enabling developers to work together more efficiently.

        3. Speeding Up Development Cycles: 
        CI enables faster feedback cycles, allowing developers to catch issues earlier in the development process, reducing the time required to fix bugs and delivering new features more quickly.

        4. Minimizing Risks: 
        By continuously integrating and testing code changes, CI helps to minimize the risk of introducing errors into the software, preventing deployment failures, and reducing overall project risks.

        5. Building Reliable Releases: 
        CI enables automated building, testing, and deployment, ensuring that software releases are reliable and consistent across different environments.

        6. Supporting Agile Development: 
        CI is well-suited for Agile development methodologies, enabling teams to quickly integrate changes and iterate on features.

        7. Providing Visibility and Traceability: 
        CI provides visibility into the development process by tracking changes and ensuring that builds and tests are consistently executed, providing traceability throughout the development cycle.

    Overall, CI is an essential tool for modern software development, helping teams to build better-quality software faster and more reliably while reducing overall project risks.

        $ chmod +x jenkins-install.sh

    5. Run the shell script file using the following command:

        $ ./jenkins-install.sh

    6. Wait for the installation process to complete.

    7. Once the installation is complete, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

        `http://<your_linux_server_ip_address>:8080`

    8. Follow the prompts to complete the Jenkins setup wizard, including creating an admin user and installing any necessary plugins.

    9. Once the setup is complete, Jenkins will be ready to use.

    
    Download Install Configure Jenkins on Windows using powershell script:

        Here are the steps to download, install, and configure Jenkins on Windows using a PowerShell script:

        1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.

        2. Create a new directory for Jenkins installation using the following command:

        ```
        New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\Program Files\Jenkins" -Force
        ```
        3. Change the directory to the Jenkins installation directory using the following command:
        
        ```
        cd "C:\Program Files\Jenkins"
        ```
        4. Download the Jenkins installation package using the following command:

        ```
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war" -OutFile "jenkins.war"
        ```

        5. Install the Jenkins service using the following command:

        ```
        java -jar .\jenkins.war --install-service
        ```

        6. Start the Jenkins service using the following command:

        ```
        Start-Service Jenkins
        ```

        7. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

        8. Follow the prompts to complete the Jenkins setup wizard, including creating an admin user and installing any necessary plugins.

        9. Once the setup is complete, Jenkins will be ready to use.

        Note: The above script is for installing Jenkins on Windows using the built-in Windows service wrapper. If you prefer to install Jenkins as a Windows service using a separate service wrapper, you will need to modify the script accordingly. Additionally, you may need to adjust the firewall settings to allow incoming traffic to port 8080.
