#### AWS Elastic Beanstalk


```
Deploying an Angular application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk requires a few additional steps compared to deploying a backend application because Angular is typically used to create single-page applications (SPAs). 
```

#### Here's how you can deploy an Angular application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

```
Prerequisites:

1. An AWS account.
2. An Angular application ready for deployment.
3. Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
4. The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured.
5. A basic understanding of AWS services.
```

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Angular Application

```
Ensure that your Angular application is production-ready by running ng build --prod. 

This command will create a dist/ directory containing the compiled assets.

Navigate to the dist/ directory and find the folder with your application's name. 

This folder contains the static files you'll deploy.
```

### Step 2: Create a New Node.js Environment in Elastic Beanstalk

```
Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Go to the Elastic Beanstalk console.

Click on “Create a new environment” and select the “Web server environment” option.
```

#### Step 3: Configure Your Environment

```
Choose a domain name for your application or leave it to AWS to generate one for you.

For the platform, select "Node.js" since Elastic Beanstalk does not have a direct environment for Angular.

Upload your Angular application's zipped dist/your-app-name folder when prompted for code.
```

#### Step 4: Provide a Configuration File

```
Elastic Beanstalk needs a configuration file to know how to serve your Angular application using Node.js.

Create a file named package.json in the root of your dist/your-app-name folder with the following content:

{
  "name": "your-app-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "http-server ./ -p 8080"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "http-server": "^0.12.3"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">= 10.13.0"
  }
}

This configuration uses http-server to serve your static files on port 8080, which is the default port Elastic Beanstalk expects your application to run on.

Zip the dist/your-app-name folder again, which now includes the package.json file.

```

#### Step 5: Deploy Your Application

```
In the Elastic Beanstalk console, with your environment selected, choose "Upload and Deploy".

Upload the updated zip file and click "Deploy".

AWS will start provisioning resources and deploying your Angular application.
```

#### Step 6: Verify the Deployment

```
Once the environment's health is "Green", click on the provided URL to view your deployed Angular application.

Your application should be accessible in a browser via the Elastic Beanstalk-provided URL.
```

#### Step 7: Update and Maintain Your Application

```
For updates, repeat the build process with ng build --prod, update the dist/your-app-name folder accordingly, zip it, and upload it to Elastic Beanstalk.
```

#### Step 8: Clean Up Resources

```
To avoid incurring charges, delete your Elastic Beanstalk environment when not in use.

Navigate to your Elastic Beanstalk dashboard, choose your environment, and select “Actions” followed by “Terminate Environment”.
```

#### Example Use Case:

```
Imagine you have developed an Angular application for a real estate listing platform. 

The application interacts with a backend API to display listings.

You would build your Angular application for production.

Deploy the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk following the steps outlined above.

Once deployed, users can access the real estate application from anywhere, view listings, and interact with your platform.

As user traffic grows, AWS Elastic Beanstalk can scale the environment to meet demand.

```

#### Conclusion:

```
AWS Elastic Beanstalk can host and scale an Angular application by handling the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. 

With the right configuration, you can deploy your Angular application to a managed environment, allowing you to focus on developing your application rather than managing infrastructure.
